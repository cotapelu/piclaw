# Agent Evolution Metrics

Log of iteration metrics for the PiClaw autonomous development system.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-06-15

**Baseline**
- Total tests: 978
- Passing: 975
- Skipped: 3
- Failed: 0 (1 failure fixed during iteration)
- Test failure rate: 0.1% initial → 0% final
- Rollbacks: 0
- Regressions: 0
- MTTR (Mean Time To Repair): ~5 minutes (identified failing test, fixed)
- Build time: ~118s
- Coverage: >70% (exact number pending)

**Changes**
- Implemented structured logger (core + extension wrapper)
- Replaced all raw `console.*` calls in production code with `logger`
- Added metrics export for team auto-dispose (`.piclaw/metrics.json`)
- Fixed logger prefix mismatch in `todos-tool` and `team-manager`
- Resolved test failure in `todos-load-edgecases.test.ts`

**Observations**
- Tests that directly spy on `console` are brittle with logger abstraction.
- No regressions introduced; all existing tests pass after adjustment.
- Logger configuration via `~/.piclaw/config.json` works; default level is `info`.

## Iteration 2 — 2026-06-15

**Security Hardening: Path Traversal Fixes**

- Fixed path traversal vulnerability in `executeRead` (`src/extensions/tools/sub-tools/computer-use.ts`): implemented secure bash with single-quote escaping and path validation within cwd. Added comprehensive tests covering traversal attempts, escaping, offset/limit combinations, error handling. All 981 tests pass.
- Addressed critical path traversal in `PiclawPackageManager` (`src/piclaw-package-manager.ts`): integrated `validateLocalPath` in `resolveExtensionSources` and `resolve`; added warning logs for invalid sources. Added security tests ensuring traversal attempts are rejected (install) or skipped (resolve). No regressions.
- Improved overall test coverage for security edge cases (tests increased from 978 to 981).

**Outcome**: All known critical path traversal vulnerabilities mitigated. File access is now confined to allowed directories. System stability maintained.

*Next iteration: address remaining HIGH risks (command injection verification), add fuzzing tests, and improve secret detection.*)
